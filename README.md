# Open Source Verilog Projects

This repository contains source code for labs and projects involving FPGA and Verilog based designs.

## To Run & Test

There are two ways to run and simulate the projects in this repository. Either use **Xilinx Vivado** or an open source EDA tool such as **EDA Playground**.

##### Option 1. Xilinx Vivado

- Run the Xilinx Vivado Suite with the module and testbench files within each project. More instructions can be found [here](https://www.xilinx.com/support/university/students.html#overview).

##### Option 2. [EDA Playground](http://www.edaplayground.com/home)

- Login with a Google or Facebook account to save and run modules and testbenches
- Testbench + Design: SystemVerilog/Verilog
- Tools & Simulators: Icarus Verilog 0.9.7
